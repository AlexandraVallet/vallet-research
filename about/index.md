I am a multi-disciplinary researcher with a deep background in physics and neuroscience. I believe that fundamental laws of physics and mathematical models will provide breakthroughs in our understanding and management of dementia in the same way as it transformed other fields, such as meteorology or aerospace, decades ago.

I studied fluid and solid mechanics in a graduate engineering school and obtained a PhD in high energy density physics. I worked in a semi industrial context as the principal investigator for experimental campaigns on the Laser [Megajoule facility](https://www-lmj.cea.fr/) (CEA – France). I coordinated work from several teams and used complex multi-physics, multi-code simulations to both design and interpret experiments reproducing ‘mini stars’ in the laboratory.

A fruitful encounter with neurosurgeon [Eric Schmidt](../members/eric-schmidt.html) and physicist [Sylvie Lorthois](../members/sylvie-lorthois.html) convinced me that current mathematical modelling capabilities, combined with existing neuroimaging technologies, provide an unprecedented opportunity to better understand brain ageing. Since 2018, I have immersed myself in neuroscience. I developed several modelling tools to predict fluid dynamics, solid deformation and fluid-structure interaction in the brain and demonstrated the potential of my transdisciplinary approach. 

I am now building an interdisciplinary [research project](../index.md) about the mechanical determinants of intracranial pulsatility.
