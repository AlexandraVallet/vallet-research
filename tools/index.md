Describing the coupling between cerebral vessels and the surrounding tissues necessitates complex multi-physics multi-scale modeling tools which we are developing and validating. The brain tissue is represented as a deformable poroelastic medium where the cells are the solid part and the interstitial fluid is the fluid part. The vascular network is represented as a network of 1D pipes.
