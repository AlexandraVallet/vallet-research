## Academic interests

Tone Berges main focus is to use molecular immunology technology to get mechanistic insights into disease mechanisms behind multiple sclerosis (MS). Berge and her students are performing molecular studies in selected immune cells to understand the biological significance behind MS susceptibility genes identified through global “omics” approaches.
